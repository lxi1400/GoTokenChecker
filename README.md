# GoTokenChecker
token checker i made a while ago, when i was first learning golang. 


# How to use

Insert the tokens you want to check into the [tokens.txt](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/835696771942449184/839361919961006110/unknown.png), and then type `go run main.go`, and it'll start checking all your tokens. The vaild tokens wil lbe put in [vaild.txt](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/835696771942449184/839362113490124820/unknown.png)

# Note

This code is pretty ugly, but it works. It was a starter project from when I first started, so yeah.
